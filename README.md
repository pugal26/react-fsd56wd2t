# ReactJS

- Is an open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs).
- It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
- It is used for its simplicity, faster performance, scalability and flexibility.

## Features

- Component-based architecture React uses a component-based architecture to build complex user interfaces. It allows you to break down your application into smaller, reusable components, which makes it easier to manage and maintain your code.

- Virtual DOM (Virtual Document Object Model) React uses a virtual DOM to improve the performance of your application. It creates a lightweight copy of the actual DOM and updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This makes your application faster and more efficient.

- JSX (JavaScript XML)

    - React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.
    - JSX will then be transformed into regular javascript using a transpiler like Babel.

- State Management React provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state of your application. It allows you to create and update the state of your components, which makes it easier to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
